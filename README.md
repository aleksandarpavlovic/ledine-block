# LediNEblock

Chrome extension that hides listings in Ledine on Serbian real estate websites.


## Why

Because most of us who look for real estate in New Belgrade municipality do not want to see ads in Ledine. Some websites let you easily filter out this ~~sh*thole~~ neighbourhood in just a few clicks, while on some other websites this seemingly simple task can get quite complicated. Ledi**NE**block spares you the trouble and does the filtering for you (Well, technically, it does not modify the filters in the http request, but simply hides DOM elements that contain the magic word. Nevertheless, the effect is pretty much the same).

## Setup

Ledi**NE**block is not yet available on chrome web store, so the only way for now is to install it manually. Clone the repository or download and unzip the source code and follow this short installation [guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked). Also make sure to [pin](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#pin_the_extension) the extension in toolbar for quick access.
